It is the marketplace ﬂip-side where there is nothing to buy or sell; our currency is energy, our deals are celestial, our contracts are sacred. Fate, fortune, and future are collective concerns, it is time to shift our forecasting from ‘what will happen to me?’ to ‘what will come of us?’ Commissioned and present-ed by Kim Fullerton at Akimbo for Art Toronto."
