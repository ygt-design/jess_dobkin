                    I currently live in Tkaronto which for thousands of years has been the traditional territory of many
                    nations including the Mississaugas of the Credit, the Anishnabeg, the Chippewa, the Haudenosaunee
                    and the Wendat peoples. It continues to be home to many Indigenous people from across Turtle Island.
                    I am grateful to have the opportunity to live, love, and work on this land.
